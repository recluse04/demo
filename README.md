	- Credit = 2 ;  Weeks = 13; 
	- Lecture time each week = 2hours; the classroom is booked from 1:00pm to 2:50pm;  We start the lecture at 1pm and usually should end  at 2pm.  2pm - 2:50 is the consultation time  in the same classroom.  

-  Rules in Class:
	- ONLY the registered students and the persons invited by the course leader can participate  this class. 
	- The use of cellphone/tablets/computers is generally not allowed unless  instructed.  
	- In many lectures,  we shall have the guest speakers.  Show  respect to our guests. Participate these events actively.
	- In case that invited speaker is late a bit and not able to start the presenation at 1pm, we may finish our lecture later than 2pm. 
 
 -  Forms of teaching-learning activities:   below are some examples of our activities in SDSC
	 - Formal lectures given by the course leader 
	 - Presentations given by the guest speaker
	 - Watch the selected  video clips (youtube/TED) from prestigous organizations  in class; 
	 -  Tutorial on the use of elementary data science computer tools 
	 -  Group discussion with peers in class
	 - Read the assigned materials (news/chapter of some reference books/long videos) and write summary after class;
	 - Group Project:  to deliver written reports or/and oral presentation.  

-  Preparation for each class
	- Bring your CityU Student Card anytime for ID verification and roll call. 
	- Bring your own smartphone which can scan QR code for the purpose  of roll call or in-class survey or pop-up quiz at Canvas;  
	- Prepare  a laptop (not tablet)  for the purpose of taking pop-up quiz. Charge your laptop before the use. Occassionally, we may have some short tutorials which needs the computer to try some software or programming. 
		> We do not have an exclusive lab available for this course. If you can not obtain a laptop, please seek help from [Computing Service Center](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/csc/) or contact SDSC General Office for inquiry of any availabe help.

- Instruction on  group projects 
	- Organization of group :   Each group should consist of **three** students (“two” or “four” is possible for very exceptional case and subject to the approval). Please form the groups among yourselves and each group leader gives me the names in your group
	- 
	
-  Assessment : (80% continuous assessment + 20%)
   - Random Roll call:  20%
   > Everyone is credited 20 points in the beginning; The $k$-th absence without justification  gets subtraction of $2^{k-1}$ point as penalty. The  total deduction is the sum of all your  penalty point ( which is $2^k -1$).  So if you have fives times of abscence, then your 20 points will be all deducted and your point becomes zero. WARNING: you may fail this course if you have zero point for roll call.
    
   - Response to oral questions and  pop-up quizz in class:  10%
   > The ranking is sorted. 
   - Group projection: oral presentation:  30%
	   - Book Review or Introduction
	   - Introduction of of a  data-science-based company 
	   - Explain one Machine Learning Technique
   - Assignment:  20%
		 - Watch a video or a book, then answer the questions at canvas.   
		 - Read the materials and answer Canvas questions;
		 - Simple Python code problem 
		 - Write a report on a selected topics
   - final exam 20%: multiple choices; closed book;

## Mathematical Setup


Machine Learning deals with the handling of enormous data sets. And an effective way to represent this data is in the form of 2D arrays or rectangular blocks in which each row represents a sample or a complete record and a column represents a feature or an attribute. It is natural to think of the array as a matrix and each column (attribute) as a vector.

We may need introduce some  basic mathematical concepts in linear algebra such as vectors, vector arithmetic(addition, subtraction, dot product) and the orthogonal projection. Some of these concepts can also be found in the article,  

1. [Prerequisites of linear algebra for machine learning](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/prerequisites-linear-algebra-machine-learning).


2. **Part I: Mathematical Foundations** in the book  [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/).  2019 by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong.  Cambridge University Press.
